# Mainstream - RSS Reader

An RSS reader built for [Exponent's winter 2016 contest](https://blog.getexponent.com/exponent-s-winter-2016-contest-is-done-72560bf05ed0#.pmcs7nlde).

Inspired heavily by [One](http://one.hackplan.com/android), which I love but I think misses some features for power users :). 

Now Open Sourced and updated to a more recent version of Exponent with navigation redone in [Ex-Navigation](https://github.com/exponentjs/ex-navigation).
